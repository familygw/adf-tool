# adfTool (in java! ported from C: https://github.com/TheDarkByte96/adfTool)

adfTool is a tool which is capable of converting encrypted sound files (.ADF) seen in GTA Vice City (radio stations) to standard .MP3 files. It is also capable of encrypting .MP3 files into .ADF formatted files.

Usage: 

       adfTool -e inputFile.mp3 outputFile.adf
       adfTool -d inputFile.adf outputFile.mp3
       

-e stands for encryption - mp3 to adf; -d stands for decryption - adf to mp3

Have fun :)
